# titanic-analysis-and-model-building

This project focuses on the Titanic dataset analysis and predictive modeling. It comprises four main stages: data exploration, data cleansing, model training, and model tuning. Each stage is designed to uncover insights, handle data quality, develop models, and optimize their performance. Transcending its technical nature, this project delves into the historical significance of the Titanic dataset, uncovering insights that offer a deeper understanding of the past and potential lessons for the present and future. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

### __Questions that were considered & answered through the data exploration:__
